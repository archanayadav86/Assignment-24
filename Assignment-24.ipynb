    "\n",
    "Ans--> Def function is used within the function name and mutiple loops can be used inside the def function and if we want to return function than we need to use return keyword whereas in lambda no need to use return explicitely it will return value without using return keyword and we cannot use multiple loops and function within lambda function."

    "2. filter() takes a function object and an iterable and creates a new list.\n",
